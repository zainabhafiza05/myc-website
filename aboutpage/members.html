        My girls couldn‚Äôt stop talking about how much fun they had solving the riddles and the scavenger hunt. And they were thrilled to be treated with goodies afterwards. May Allah SWT bless you all with His finest blessings, put barakah in your time, and reward you abundantly for dedicating so much effort to making our kids happy.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

        JazakhAllah Khairan for conducting the sisters' side and arranging an appropriate breakfast spread. The students absolutely enjoyed it. The souvenir packets were also very thoughtful and a good way to invite them to Islam. May Allah bless you and your organization.
