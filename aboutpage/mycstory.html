    <h3>Why MYC Exists</h3>
    <p>
      Muslimah Youth for Change was born from a simple yet powerful realization: young Muslim girls in East Seattle needed a space where they could truly be themselves while staying connected to their faith and heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded five years ago by a group of passionate Muslim women, MYC emerged from countless conversations with young Muslimahs who felt caught between two worlds â€” their rich Islamic identity and the modern American society they navigate daily.
    </p>
    <p>
      We saw brilliant, ambitious young women struggling to find their voice, questioning whether they could pursue their dreams while honoring their values. We witnessed the isolation many felt, lacking role models who looked like them and shared their experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, MYC stands as a beacon of empowerment, providing mentorship, sisterhood, and unwavering support to help young Muslimahs embrace their full potential while staying rooted in their faith.
