    <h3>Why MYC Exists</h3>
    <p>
      MYC was born from friendship, faith, and a shared vision. As middle schoolers, the founders of MYC met at masjid programs, summer camps, and community events, where we quickly became close friends. Ambitious and full of ideas, we loved having fun and trying new things — but we soon realized there wasn’t a space where we could truly be ourselves, stay connected to our faith, and engage in meaningful activities with other Muslim girls who shared our values.
    </p>
    <p>
      We felt caught between two worlds — our rich Islamic identity and the modern American society we navigated daily. We struggled to find our voice and questioned whether we, as Muslimahs, could pursue our dreams while honoring our faith. We also noticed the absence of role models who looked like us and understood our experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Determined to create that space, we started our first Muslim girls soccer camp in 2016 — an initiative that combined fun, community, and faith. As we grew, we expanded our efforts: teaching at our masjids, running summer camps, and fostering a community through shared experiences. Along the way, we became best friends, united by our passion for service, faith, and leadership.

      <strong>We wanted to bring positive change as youth Muslimahs — so we created Muslimah Youth for Change (MYC), officially established in 2021,</strong> turning our vision into a lasting platform for young Muslimahs to connect, learn, and thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through MYC, we provide the support and guidance we once wished for: mentorship, sisterhood, and opportunities for young girls to develop leadership skills, build lasting friendships, and embrace their full potential while staying rooted in Islam. Our experiences have shown us the power of good company, inspiring role models, and a meaningful community — and we are committed to giving back by nurturing the next generation of confident, ambitious, and faith-centered Muslim women Insha Allah.
